# JCAT Tracker

The main codes of the JCAT tracker will be available as soon as possible.

## Running Environments
* Pytorch 1.1.0, Python 3.6.12, Cuda 9.0, torchvision 0.3.0, cudatoolkit 9.0, Matlab R2016b.
* Ubuntu 16.04, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080Ti.

## Installation
The instructions have been tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 system. In case of issues, we refer to these two links [1](https://github.com/alanlukezic/d3s) and [2](https://github.com/visionml/pytracking) for details.

#### Clone the GIT repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Yang428/JCAT.git.
```

#### Install dependent libraries
Run the installation script 'install.sh' to install all dependencies. We refer to [this link](https://github.com/visionml/pytracking/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for step-by-step instructions.
```
bash install.sh conda_install_path pytracking
```

#### Download the pre-trained networks
You can download the models from the [Baidu cloud link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aayqXtFBeqggeZKS2dMnxA), the extraction code is '6ka4'. Then put the model files 'JcatNet.pth.tar' to the subfolder 'pytracking/networks'.

## Testing the tracker
There are the [raw resullts](https://github.com/Yang428/JCAT/tree/master/resultsOnBenchmarks) on seven datasets. 
1) Download the testing datasets Got-10k, TrackingNet, OTB100, VOT2016, VOT2018, VOT2019 and VOT2020 from the following Baidu cloud links.
* [Got-10k](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1t_PvpIicHc0U9yR4upf-cA), the extraction code is '78hq'.
* [TrackingNet](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1BKtc4ndh_QrMiXF4fBB2sQ), the extraction code is '5pj8'.
* [OTB100](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TC6BF9erhDCENGYElfS3sw), the extraction code is '9x8q'.
* [VOT2016](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iU88Aqq9mvv9V4ZwY4gUuw), the extraction code is '8f6w'.
* [VOT2018](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ztAfNwahpDBDssnEYONDuw), the extraction code is 'jsgt'.
* [VOT2019](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vf7l4sQMCxZY_fDsHkuwTA), the extraction code is '61kh'.
* [VOT2020](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16PFiEdnYQDIGh4ZDxeNB_w), the extraction code is 'kdag'.
* Or you can download almost all tracking datasets from this web [link](https://blog.csdn.net/laizi_laizi/article/details/105447947#VisDrone_77).

2) Change the following paths to you own paths.
```
Network path: pytracking/parameters/Jcat/Jcat.py  params.segm_net_path.
Results path: pytracking/evaluation/local.py  settings.network_path, settings.results_path, dataset_path.
```
3) Run the JCAT tracker on Got10k, TrackingNet and OTB100 datasets.
```
cd pytracking
python run_experiment.py myexperiments got10k
python run_experiment.py myexperiments trackingnet
python run_experiment.py myexperiments otb
```

## Evaluation on VOT16, VOT18 and VOT19 using Matlab R2016b
We provide a [VOT Matlab toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit-legacy) integration for the JCAT tracker. There is the [tracker_JCAT.m](https://github.com/Yang428/JCAT/tree/master/pytracking/utils) Matlab file in the 'pytracking/utils', which can be connected with the toolkit. It uses the 'pytracking/vot_wrapper.py' script to integrate the tracker to the toolkit.

## Evaluation on VOT2020 using Python Toolkit
We provide a [VOT Python toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit) integration for the JCAT tracker. There is the [trackers.ini](https://github.com/Yang428/JCAT/tree/master/pytracking/utils) setting file in the 'pytracking/utils', which can be connected with the toolkit. It uses the 'pytracking/vot20_wrapper.py' script to integrate the tracker to the toolkit.
```
cd pytracking/workspace_vot2020
pip install git+https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit-python
vot initialize <vot2020> --workspace ./workspace_vot2020/
vot evaluate JCAT
vot analysis --workspace ./workspace_vot2020/JCAT
```

## Training the network
The JCAT network is trained only on the YouTube VOS dataset. Download the VOS training dataset (2018 version) and copy the files vos-list-train.txt and vos-list-val.txt from ltr/data_specs to the training directory of the VOS dataset.
1) Download the training dataset from [this link](https://youtube-vos.org/challenge/2018/).

2) Change the following paths to you own paths.
```
Workspace: ltr/admin/local.py  workspace_dir.
Dataset: ltr/admin/local.py  vos_dir.
```
3) Taining the JCAT network
```
cd ltr
python run_training.py Jcat Jcat_default
```
